# graduation-work
My graduation work is dedicated to the topic "Architecture of the intelligent system of acquisition and retention evaluation in video games industry". It has two parts. The first part consists of Beautiful Soup based web scraper of game reviews on the Steam website (some data is also extracted through the API), the second part builds SpaCy classification model and provides words frequency analysis. The data is processed in pandas data frame structures.

These scripts do the following:

1. Get games info from Steam (getGamesInfo)
2. Get reviews from Steam (getReviews)
3. Get IGDB ratings
4. Build an NLP model for review categorization
5. Provide words frequency analysis
