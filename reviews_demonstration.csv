4,1085660,"Destiny is a beautiful game with lots of things for you to invest your time in. While its true that the game has had its ups and downs over the past few years, I cant agree that the game is dead. There are still plenty of exciting things coming and available in the game. Especially the large amount of lore currently playing out in the game. If you are a free to play player the amount of content is a little lacking but there is still some pretty good activities for you to do, if you get past the first few new light mission. (They are a little long and boring but help you figure out how the game works.)

As I said there have been some ups and downs and there are still some things that need to be fixed in the game, such as:

Anti-Cheat: There is currently no anti-cheat in the game. There has been talk about an anti cheat coming in the near future but the game hasnt had one for the past 4 years. So expect to face one or multiple hackers in end game content, mostly Competitive PVP.

Sandbox: Destiny 2 has a PVP and PVE aspect to them and because of that, 2 different sandboxes. They have to make sure that not one weapon is decent in fair in one sandbox and be completely broken in the other sandbox. Due to that the sandbox isn't entirely even or fair. They usually fix in a few weeks but that still is something to watch out for when playing.

Dry content: Currently Destiny 2 has seasons which indicate where we are storywise and fills content between DLC's. It was the right decision to do so but the seasons are fairly long and can get a little bit dry at the end of every season. You would be done with everything storywise in a season within a few weeks and besides grinding certain activities and maybe a live event during the end of the season, there isn't really much to do if you arent a heavy grinder. Which makes some players take a break from the game or even quit.

I am not here to say that bungie is doing everything wrong. They do plenty of good things as well which I will go over now:

Weapon Mod and Armor Mod system: The way the armor and weapons work in D2 currently is one of the most amazing things I have seen in a videogame. Its not too complex but can change the way you play the game, drastically sometimes.

Class System: The design for the classes is really good and give you a wide range of choices especially with the stasis.

Story and Lore: The game has a lot of deep lore and stories for you to find, read and be amazed about future stories. 

Now i know it sounds like the game is worse than better in this review, but it is not. I love this game and most faults can generally be ignored if you play the game long enough. If you invest time in this game it will definitely be worth it.",1

7,1085660,This used to be the best MMORPG shooter ever. It is still is a fun shooter but the devs just ruined it over the last couple of years with the season pass model (it sounded good but wasn't (except Season of Opulence)). Still worth playing though.,1

26,1085660,"Don't get me wrong, game is lovely. 

Bungie however is screwing up big time. They have no control over the hackers in their game since they went to steam. 
Which is already causing major problems in the crucible. 
And are simply straight up banning every1 who gets reported or ends up in a lobby with an actual hacker. 

Myself included. And before you go, sure homie... I have been here since CB of D1, have all expansions and DLC's from the very beginning on both PC and PS4. Ya think i'd do something to get myself banned? Really?

Anyways, long story short. If you're either reported or end up in a lobby with a hacker. YOU ARE F*CKED!
You will get banned, and even after 3 tickets asking for at least the reason why you're banned. You will be answered with generic BS messages. They won't even take the time to read your apeal.

33,1085660,"I am very much a casual Destiny fan, so the meta and grind does not really come into play for me for the most part. I enjoy the solid moment to moment gunplay and exploration. 
The environments still look fantastic even with Destiny 2 getting higher in years. The sound and visuals are all very well done. Plenty of wow moments with large set pieces. 
 There are lots of group events to join everywhere and group stuff is where I think this game shines. Seeing 3 guardians rushing in together and slaughtering the enemies is always fun to watch. 
I do recommend this game but for me this is a game I would only buy on sale. The content does feel segmented with how it is monetized but overall not terrible.
Give it a shot if you can find the game with it's DLC on sale. ",1

49,1085660,"Unlike Destiny 1, this installment offers little innovation. There´s a basic model here that was implemented on all expansions, on every stage of Destiny 2 to date:

1) Make a great introductory mission, get players hooked.
2) Make a few updates
3) Copy and paste activities and missions.

From the start this game had no soul, no love at all.

Really different experience from Destiny 1. Played the demo, it sucked but the introductory mission was great. Thought to myself ""Well, D1 was great, let´s give it a chance"".

Wrong decision! Not going to lie, it has some good moments and pvp is still fun. Some strikes and raids are fun as well, that´s why it has the score it has, but wow...it´s years behind the first one in the fun factor.

If I have to congratulate Bungie in any area, that would be in the marketing department. EXCELLENT trailers.",1

61,1085660,"As a fan of the original Destiny, playing it all the way back to the first week of release, D2 just seems like a shadow of its former self. I played this when it first came out and my initial opinion was that it was a worthy successor to D1 that improved many gameplay and story aspects. Over the years, however, I've played on and off and my opinion only goes down. Really everything went downhill after it became a free-to-play game, and when the latest Fallen DLC came out, I just lost all my will to play.

[h1]The Big Problem[/h1]
Too much content. You take a two week break and you miss a 10GB update (I'm exaggerating). Bungie already took steps to shrink the game because it got to an unmanageable size, and I was glad that they did this because I would have never completed every activity the game had to offer. Still though, there is way too much stuff to do and keep track of. It does not feel like a casual game anymore, it just feels like a neverending grind. And the worst part is that if you don't have a bunch of friends you can play with, you'll never really get anywhere. Destiny has NEVER been a reliable singleplayer game, but ever since the end of D1 days, all of my Destiny friends are gone, especially here on PC. Usually Bungie is able to dish out good singleplayer experiences, but not in the current state of D2. 

This is all not mentioning the absolute trainwreck that was the latest DLC, which was a rehash of the same old crap I've seen before in House of Wolves and literally every single Fallen-centric storyline ever. The new stasis abilities were underwhelming as well. I couldn't even finish it, I got so bored of it in the first two levels.",0
62,1085660,"Destiny 2 is a very photogenic and atmospheric game, filled with quests, mysteries and pvp/pve. The downside to this game, is that is is not very friendly towards new players tuning in. But since it is a free gaming experience you should for sure give it a try!",1

94,1085660,"This game peaked at Forsaken. Shadowkeep was kinda eh, Beyond Light was eh but a quite a bit better than Shadowkeep, and the seasons throughout ranged from content-less (season of arrivals) to really really good (season of the splicer), and raids like Last Wish and Vault of Glass are amazing and great fun to do with others. Overall its kinda ok i guess",1
95,1085660,"I hate this game to an extent, but it's my most played game on Steam. Perhaps my most played game in general.

TL;DR: DON’T TRY THIS GAME! It combines the addictive nature of heroin, and the highs and lows of an abusive relationship. The game makes me feel like shit, and I can’t stop coming back. I regret how much time I've already put in this game, even though I know I'm only going to keep on playing it. I don't feel any satisfaction in it. Only a fleeting sense of pride and accomplishment after getting some weapon, which fades as I start on another long ass quest-line. There are way more fulfilling games out there. Please don't try this game, it's a massive, unsatisfactory time-sink that's addictive as fuck.

Does this game fix everything that people complained about in Destiny 1? No. I’ll start with the story. 

Edit: With the introduction of the content vault, the first 3 campaigns were removed. This is not a major loss however, because those campaigns were shallow and boring. I previously had a whole paragraph dedicated to how much these campaigns sucked, but now they're gone. I suppose now if you're looking for a guided narrative experience, you'll need to get one of the DLCs. IMO, the only one absolutely not worth getting is Shadowkeep. Forsaken is the best campaign in Destiny 2 (it's not necessarily a masterpiece, there's just not much competition). Beyond Light isn't anything special, but it's better than Shadowkeep.

However it's important to remember that the campaign isn't the game's main focus. This leads us to another question: Is the game still grindy as fuck? Yeah. This is where my main criticism comes in. There are so many quests, I constantly feel urged to complete them. I never do something in Destiny just because it's fun; I'm always trying to grind out various quests. For what? Just some weapons that'll sit in my vault since like any game, some weapons are better than others. Honestly for PvE, you don't necessarily need the meta items (unless you're doing the top level shit). And in general, if you get a few top tier weapons, you’ll be able to do just fine without getting all the rest of them.

Edit: Recently, Bungie actually made the new player experience better. Now they have a whole guided sequence that better teaches new players what to do. They will no longer need to be guided by veterans, at least not as much as before.

Let’s talk about some of the positives. The moment to moment gun-play is incredibly entertaining. I don’t know how to describe it, perhaps “satisfying” is the word. It just feels really smooth and fun (from a PvE standpoint). But the game's main redemption is the more challenging content (most of the game, particularly the campaigns are trivial) such as Raids and Nightfall strikes. Raids in particular include challenging and convoluted puzzles requiring coordination and communication. This makes them a fun challenge, once you get a fire team to do them (you can't match-make for Raids). It's also very likely that you'll get stuck in one area because 1: you don't get what the fuck is going on or 2: your teammates don't get what the fuck is going on.


One of the game’s multiplayer modes is Gambit which can be labeled as ""Competitive PvE"". To broadly summarize, teams must kill groups of enemies quickly, gather resources from them, and deposit them. Depositing enough resources summons a boss. Whichever team kills the boss first wins. The only wrinkle in this is that during the game, portals open up allowing players to infiltrate the other team’s session and try to kill them. Since you drop motes on death, this can be a great hindrance. In some cases, the loss can be devastating. If your team is holding a large amount of motes and someone wipes your team, you may as well give up. I personally don’t like this game mode. One of the main problems is that the mode has a lot of subtleties that aren’t explained well in game. As a result most of the players you match-make with will probably make preventable mistakes that’ll cost you the game.

Crucible is one of the most enraging things I've played in recent memory. The main fundamental problem with Crucible is that it's sandbox was built for PvE. Each of the classes has powerful abilities and supers that create encounters feel like you couldn't have done anything about it. I have a friend that jokes that half of Crucible is running away from supers; it's not as much of an exaggeration as you may think. When an enemy activates their super in your vicinity, you have 3 options. Try to fight them, which will result in your death; try to run, which will likely end with your death; or you can accept your fate and contemplate what brought you to this moment. 

Not where your character is standing, but you. What have you become? Is this what it’s all been leading up to? Slaving away to a soulless game that gives nothing in return. ‘Why do you still do this?’, you ponder, as the Titan plows into you with their Fist of Havoc.

Oh sorry I got distracted, anyways I would assume it's also difficult for Bungie to keep the game balanced because of the earlier fundamental problem. Any changes they make to weapons, armor, and abilities also carry over to PvE, which is a whole different game. So while Bungie may face balance problems akin to any other in modern shooters, their ability to balance things is likely hampered by considerations of PvE, IMO. Crucible is a hell that I wouldn't wish upon anyone.

Let's talk about sunsetting for a minute. Its perhaps the most controversial update in Destiny 2's history. Now, a lot of things were removed, yes. However, many of these things weren't relevant for people to do anymore. I'll briefly list the only things I miss that got removed: Playlist maps, Reckoning, Black Armory, 17ish exotic quests, tribute hall, drifter narrative quests, Menagerie. The removal of 4 planetary locations sounds like a lot until you realize that for the most part, there wasn't anything worth doing on those planets. The loss of 3 campaigns sound like a lot until you realize that 2 of them were small dlc campaigns. New players will be completely lost if they start with Forsaken's campaign, however to be fair, Red War was merely a servicable introduction at best. Here are my thoughts on the campaigns: long winded & boring & generic, starts kinda interesting but becomes boring, and so boring & short that you go ""really, that was it?"". The elephant in the room is the massive reduction to the weapon sandbox. While I appreciate Bungie's effort to change up the meta (so that mountaintops and recluses aren't all you see forever), I feel like they could've whittled down the viable weapons more gradually. I'll conclude by saying that yes, new players won't have much to do anymore. But I really think people are making this sunsetting look worse than it actually is.

I have to comment on the recent seasons because Bungie has been doing more to create a gradually progressing story in them than before. In the current season (Season of the Splicer), the story is gradually fed to us a bit every week. This makes it more rewarding to keep coming back each week, even if just for a bit. If they keep this up, it'll be harder and harder to not recommend this game.


Overall opinion: Don’t play this game. It is free, but there is so much out there that offers real satisfaction. Games with real stories that you can get invested in. Characters you can care about, rather than cardboard figures of tropes. Gameplay that makes you feel proud, rather than empty. Don’t play this game. Don’t play this game. Don’t play this game. DON’T PLAY THIS GAME!",0

106,252490,"Great game with a very toxic but funny community.

Base-building at its finest, offline raiding some poor chap when he just logs off destroying the base, robbing his stuff and increasing our wealth.

Gunplay is enjoyable, with predicted recoil after playing for over 230 hours.
Seeing different types of bases is cool, large and small. Destroyed and almost impenetrable. 

The gameplay is very unique and enjoyable with days being lost just building your base, scouting for other bases to raid and upgrading the defences of your base.

Playing with friends is also a fun and unique way of playing, especially when in the middle of an online raid and bullets flying past you from every direction.

Solos can be a challenge playing against players who are solo themselves or are apart of large team. Although, killing the squad is very fulfilling.

203,381210,"Let me start off by saying that I've rewritten this review several times. 
This is due to the game changing moderately with each major update.
So, is Dead by Daylight (DBD) a good game? Unfortunately no, it's not...
I've been playing DBD for about a year now, and in less than a year I've played for more than a thousend hours.
If I've spent this much time on this game, than it's surely good? Nope, it really isn't.
On the daily basis that I've played this game, I've encountered at least one bug during each session.
Most of the bugs/glitches are in fact, 'game breaking.""
Whether I'm stuck in a locker, or being hit through a pallet...
DBD contains more bugs than a rain forest.
Other than the technical issues (bugs/glitches), there's other problems too.
Problems such as; Micro-Transactions, Toxic Community and most importantly, incompetent developers.
If there's so much cons...What's the pros?
Well, it's not all bad... 
The concept is great, the gameplay is fun, and it's really addictive.
But that's about it, I don't recommend it.",0
204,381210,"This game is akin to being in an abusive relationship. I know it's bad for me, but I can't stop myself from playing. The game's quality continues to deteriorate, but I keep coming back for more.

If you're playing Killer, just quit. These ""survivors"" are nothing more than arrogant social outcasts who will do anything they can to ruin your day. Despite the fact that they only received the game a few weeks ago, they already have thousands of the same item. Oh, okay. I suppose a better gaming chair is enchasing their performance?

You win if you play survivor. That is all there is to it. It's really simple to escape the trial. Turn off your computer's monitor and spam buttons. It doesn't matter how good you are! You'll be okay if you toss in a few overpowered add-ons and equip some very strong perks. Genrushing is completely acceptable in this God-awful community. Camping doors? Fine. Camping Killers with flashlights? Fine. Survivors are so disgustingly entitled it makes the worst, snob-nosed, spoiled little kid look like a saint. But if a Killer even dares to be within 26 miles of a hooked survivor, they are facecamping and deserve a ban. 

So, you'd like to be a part of the DbD community? Are you certain? This is a more significant decision than marrying, having a child, purchasing a home, and purchasing a car all together. It's so poisonous and revolting that it makes me question our purpose on this planet. What exactly do I mean? Take a look at [url=store.steampowered.com]DbD's official Twitter feed[/url] for some responses. Need I say more?

Now for the new information. Is it really necessary for me to explain myself here? Although the Resident Evil chapter and its characters were excellent, the launch was not. On the first day of the game, the map was removed. By the way, you read that properly. Did they even test the game before it went live? They didn't, of course. ""But wait!"" you say. ""Don't they have a public beta testing server that's free?"" Yes, they absolutely do! Even though it is used for community feedback, the developers are either blind, deaf, or both. They quite literally heard what we had to say about the whole desync debacle (which is a whole other topic in itself, but it included the perspectives of both survivors and Killers and their locations being totally different, meaning the Killer could hit the survivor even though the survivor wasn't hit in that location on their screen.) and did absolutely nothing for about a week. I'd rather be stuck in the Call of Duty: Black Ops IIII cycle for all of eternity than have to go through another DbD update cycle.

So, should you get this game? Absolutely not. Play literally any other game. As the game's very own director, Mathieu Ceto, said himself: ""Play something else for a week. Try civilization or something for a refreshing change."" Take his advice. Run and never look back. By the way, he was replying to a question about Killers being underpowered. That is the context. Really makes you think, huh?",0

224,381210,"In this game you pay for a bad experience.
1.Many game functions do not function properly. Pallets often dont stun killers and you get hit through them. Vaults can be faster or slower mid chase for some reason. Dead Hard is dissapointing people most of the time.
2.Bad map design. Indoor maps have millions of pallets or vaults but outdoors maps have big ass dead zones where against killers like Bubba you just have to deal with the fact that youll get downed. And when you talk about it people will just tell you ""dont get caught in the open"" like you dont have to do gens.
3.Perks and abilities. You made this game PTW with all the perks and abilities from the licensed characters. So many perks are useless but some are OP and overused which are most often those from licensed killers.
4.Object placement. Totems are placed in the wide open and are free for the picking which mostly makes killer players not take totem perks at all. Pallet and vault placements are garbage.
5.The game optimization and the servers. I thought that the fps was falling on my pc but i run games that require way stronger PCs than this garbage and they run at 144 fps but in this game for some reason on medium and even low quality i get fps drops or some kind of lag tearing be i streaming or not. 
6.Hitboxes. Why are they so garbage? Ranged killers like Huntress or Trickster prove my point where you can be behind something and you see that the ranged attack does not make contact with your character but you still get hit.
7.Desync. Is it really so hard to fix? You can get hit through vaults that you vaulted six years ago or get hit when a killer swings at a place you were a minute ago. 
8.Players. You will run into people for which you will question how are they in that certain rank. And for the killers you will be camped and tunneled and the game or the devs will not do ANYTHING about it.
9.Tunneling and camping. Why is it still a thing? The hilarious thing for me is when you get unhooked without BT and the killer is there. Why not make BT a non perk thing that just happens when youre unhooked to prevent tunneling? And DS the only anti tunneling perk is so easily avoidable by slugging BUT they even nerfed it and thus no one is using it anymore and the killers can freely tunnel EVERYONE. Or if the killer is camping make the hook progress slow down? Just so the game goes back from being so killer sided and that the killer cannot hold a survivor hostage. How didnt any of the devs think of this?
10. Add-ons. There are so much overpowered add-on combos and they nerfed only one after years of feedback from players.

277,381210,"After being unsuccessful in convincing one of my friends to like this game, or even just play it for more than 5 hours at all, I concluded that the biggest problem I have with this game is the fact that it's one of the least beginner-friendly games I have ever seen. Allow me to demonstrate.

The core mechanics of this game are pretty straightforward, not much to comment on that. You don't need a deep understanding of the game to have fun in the ranks 20-15, but once you pass that threshold, you're going to be overwhelmed, not just as a survivor, but also as a killer. As a survivor, you're tasked with wasting the killer's time. You do this by looping, a technique that takes a very long time to master. You need to understand different types of structures on the maps, learn the layouts, what's an unsafe loop, and more. I'd say the average survivor will only learn this stuff beyond 300 hours of game play. That is wrong. On top of this, it's advisable that you become familiar with all of the killers' powers and add-ons, in order to counter them more efficiently. Good luck with that.

The killer side is just as interesting. You might enjoy the first 5 games you play, but as soon as you go down in ranks, you're going to be faced with the failure that is the matchmaking system, a problem that has persisted since.. forever. I can't name a single new killer player that likes to go against red ranks in his first few games. You're straight up not going to have a good time, nor learn anything. Some people might say"" just deal with it, it's a learning experience"". It really isn't. What's there to learn from being bullied by the survivors. This almighty killer figure that supposedly poses a threat is reduced to nothing but a laughing stock. That person is most likely never going to play killer ever again. Oh yeah, as if there wasn't a shortage of killer players already.

I could also go into detail as to why progressing in this game is such a headache, obtaining the perks you like on the characters of your choosing requiring hundreds of hours of grinding, or taking just as long to unlock survivors and killers with shards if you refuse to pay with real money (as you go, you'll notice that this game REALLY wants you to pay for stuff with real money), but many people here have done it already. Same with the endless bugs. Each patch brings more bugs and glitches than it actually fixes.

Part of me still really enjoys this game and wants to see it do well, but in its current state, I have no choice but not to recommend it to anyone.",0

Constant bullying, Only a few good people left on here but mostly its full of toxic Red ranks. Que times are too long. probably because most killers quit from all toxic survivors in the game. So if you want to be a dick and have it easy buy the game for the survivor role but can't recommend killer as much until you get a meta build that will just get you bullied anyway because survivors have thier own made up rules on what is okay for a killer to use.",0

289,381210,"Dead By Daylight was one of those games I saw people streaming for a long time and never understood it. Then at a whim I decided to pick it up about 2 years ago. Big Brain Move! It's a great PVP experience with great atmosphere and updates.

Things I like:
Characters are awesome and (somewhat) unique
Regular updates and patches, often not requiring paid DLC
Very friendly dev team
The King of asymmetrical gameplay 1v4
Lots of room for more killers and survivors
FANTASTIC game to stream

Things I don't like:
Some say the community is toxic...I say that's just the internet...but stop teabagging you jerks!
Often releases have new bugs that need to be fixed (they get fixed though)
Matchmaking needs work
Survivor has long queues and much harder to level characters compared to killer

I'm proud to say that Valheim is one of the few we actually managed to stick to. It almost left a hole when we finished.

Also Bonemass can suck it.",1
301,892970,"This game is a lot of fun!!! 

It's great to play with a group of friends, and its easy to spend hours crafting, creating and exploring. I like some of the realistic components in it that you wouldn't find in other survival games, like dying of smoke inhalation if you don't build an adequate chimney or venting system. 

The only frustrating thing with this game that I have found is how slow the leveling system is, and the penalty for dying makes leveling much much harder and the penalties get steeper the higher your levels are. This can create a lot of frustration around level grinding since the higher level you are, the more time and exp it takes. Would like to see that a little more balanced.",1

Game crashed, only once though.
Skeleton spawned inside a rock. (once)

2nd ship has only 4 slot inventory. (haven't got larger ship if there is one)
Not being able to teleport with ore's, though that's friend's problem, i don't mind it.
After few hour playtime game gets laggy. (Personally on average i have 90~fps, after few hours(6+-) in few places it drops to 20-40 fps) After game restart it's fine.

Up to ten people can play too, though if you play with friends, I would recommend a dedicated server. All that you see advertised is in fact there, and more.

353,892970,"I really like this game, seriously, I like it and mostly enjoy playing it. It has all the right elements for a great game of discovery and survival, and it is very beautiful - I have a lot of great screenshots. There are just three main things wrong with it.
1) Your stamina kills you all the time. Yes you run out of stamina so fast when fighting monsters (e.g. massive trolls) and so then you can't run, can't fight and get killed. The only way I can kill big monsters is to shoot flame or bronze-tipped arrows from a distance, otherwise I'm dead.
2) So use a potion of stamina you say, or something else? Ah, next ridiculous limitation - you have only 8 quick slot - keys 1 to 8 for everything.  What about the other keys you say? Yes what about them - even '9' and '0' are not available. I have keys 1-5 for my sword/bow/axe/hammer/shield, and 6-8 for food since you need to keep eating often and can only eat 3 different things to keep your continually falling HP and stamina up.
3) So use better options for food, armour, weapons, levelling up? Oh, how? I have beaten the first two bosses and managed to find out about and making brass and brewing better food, but what else is there? No idea as the stupid raven that appears early on to help you stops appearing and telling you anything. 
I suppose there are video post 'reveals' and such out there which tell you everything, but why do I need to look at them to discover what I can do - that kills the whole discovery immersion in the game. I see pictures of villages and big boats and all sorts of things on the promos for the game, but where are they, how do I get them, and will they help me stop dying from loss of stamina?
As I said, I really like this game, but I'm not sure I want to play is anymore - I'm so tired of suddenly being killed and having to find some food, armour and weapons in a remote location, and then trying to get my stuff back without being killed a second time. 
If the devs can spend some effort to put more assignable quick-keys for items, and some clues into the game as to how to progress further at each stage and discover new things, that would interest me to continue playing. If they can also do something to train or improve you stamina in fighting, that would also be top.
(btw for anyone who thinks I'm just a whinger; you should know I'm a technical business analyst with 35+ years experience building a vast range of complex software solutions, now in forced retirement due to losing almost all my eyesight, i.e. I'm legally blind.)",0

This game at its core is not incredibly complex. Simplified combat, fairly basic building, simple leveling system and player progression. The armor, weapons and tools systems are all pretty straightforward. And yet... This game just works beautifully. All of its components compliment each other and mesh in a fun and satisfying way.

359,892970,"Valheim is like a lost happiness I have not felt in years from when the only thing that filled my mind was curiosity and adventure with a famished appetite to learn. 

Even though the graphics may not seem all that great the aesthetic scenery and soul soothing music of Valheim lets your weary mind defuse and you'll be lost in the game for hours on end. 

Valheim does not raise shy vikings and only lets the strong strive yet does not make you feel like your too slow or too fast in your progress. It leaves you to tread your path at your own pace. With every step of the way feeling like a new challenge not ever allowing you to get cocky without consequence. There is always a shimmer of light at the other end just don't give up!

I appreciate nothing more than attention to detail and the Valheim developers nailed it right on the head with small details that make a big difference over time. Something insignificant at the start suddenly finds value as the highly addictive elixir of wisdom fills your mug. 
I highly recommend Valheim to anybody.

If you ever feel alone I recommend you hop onto the official Valheim discord server and you'll find hundreds of other vikings to sail the seas with and impress the gods by showing your valiance.

👍👍
but it only bothers me because my play style leans more towards building.
so if the building is what ur buying this game for, don't fight the bosses until you have dug lots of trenches and places lots of crafting tables (spawn proofing, let's hope they don't patch that mechanic)

382,892970,"This is one of the most impressive early access games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I don't usually buy into unfinished products, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews piqued my interest.

I still can't wrap my head around the fact that this game is less than 1GB in size despite its massive world size. Valheim doesn't try to push the best 4k quality textures; it has elegance in its own right. I am also amazed about the construction and deconstruction of environments. I don't feel limited when I have a base concept in mind unlike ARK. You know what else is awesome? The fact that you are not level-locked. If you get a new ingredient, you unlock a crafting recipe. That's it. The water physics are very nice: It makes the storms feel more threatening when you're riding your boat through it. I know it's not a finished game yet, but I feel like the monsters are kind of lame. I never looked at any guides for the mobs so it was fun encountering a new enemy, but it got old pretty quick because they're easy to avoid or kill by kiting them through water or getting high ground. The bosses are too easy because their move sets are slow and clunky. Every new boss encounter just added 2,500hp: That doesn't make a battle more difficult, but rather dragged out. 

Would I recommend it? Well I got 100 hours out of a game with a $20 price tag. Personally I don't buy games with $60 price tags if I can't get at least 30 hours out of it, so Valheim hit it out of the park. Buy it. Play it with your friends for the best experience. I look forward to Valheim's completion.


Edit: 6/22/2021 - I still do recommend this game. However, I am extremely disappointed that new content isn't being created as fast as it should be. This game was rated ""overwhelmingly positive"" by the people because it started off on the right track. This is not time to get lazy. With the amount of copies sold, the developer should be hiring more employees: The revenue is there. If you run away with the money, you will be known as the reverse no man's sky.",1

384,892970,"Absolutely engaging early-game, even for a solo grinder like myself. Even though this doesn't have much plot, I find myself immersed in the world of VALHEIM! I would really suggest this game, even if it's only good for 25 hours (it has 200 hours worth of content though), as this game is fun, immersive and appeals to most gamer audiences (it's only TWENTY DOLLARS too). I'll update this once I get further into the game, but in two days I find myself putting in 20+ hours of work already! It's gonna be a good one.",1
385,892970,"Harvest stuff, kill stuff, build stuff, build more stuff, kill bosses, go sailing, kill meaner stuff, etc.",1
386,892970,"In a saturated market for survivalist titles, Valheim shines.

The most striking part of Valheim is the audio/visual beauty. The dev team have managed to capture the spirit of those mods you'd see in skyrim or minecraft that create aesthetically pleasing environments. Forgetting the actual progression and 'plot' content, I could be contented to simply plant and walk among orchards of trees till the end of time.

But you didn't come here for that, did you?

• While the building mechanics are not wildly different in comparison with games such as Rust, the Forest, Conan Exiles and etc, Valheim does manage to accomplish a notable job in making building a comfortable experience. 

• The progression system encourages a seamless gameplay feedback loop that rewards intelligent use of resources.

• The overarching story and mystery just behind the veil is satisfying, and doesn't punish you for not pursuing it.

• The multiplayer experience is excellent for veterans of all other titles in this genre, albeit the ranged combat has been inverted substantially. 

My love for the beauty of this game is paired with respect for the excellent workmanship that is so readily apparent. Coffee Stain & Iron Gate, you've proven again to be worthy of the players wallet. I look forward to your future.",1

Also stay away from the Plains until you get Iron gear because you will die A LOT, Trust me and learn from my mistakes!

You'll get an easy good ten hours out of it and if you play with friends an easy thirty, it's really fun. Though I do find I rejoin these days just for updates and bug patches to see how the games doing, you do every kind of map so many times and it gets repetetive.

438,739630,"It's scary, but not for diehard horror game fans. If you're with a few friends you'll laugh way more than you'll scream.
It's got some bugs for sure (Early Access), but the gameplay is silky smooth and more than fun enough to make you completely forget about them! Constant updates and improvements to the game make it totally worth owning even if you only play it a couple times a month.

Summary: 
Funny as hell with a few friends, locking each other in a room with an ouija board and a demon... But if you're playing solo, it's enough to make a grown man alt+f4.
",1
439,739630,"It is both fun and terrifying! Playing with your friends can make it a lot easier than playing by yourself, but it is fun either way.

447,739630,brilliant,1
448,739630,The new update making me piss myself,1
449,739630,"An amazing concept executed brilliantly! 

Phasmophobia handles horror so well, due to atmosphere and making you feel watched at all times. You have many tools to find the ghost, but next to nothing to use to defend yourself with, with a few exceptions. The fact that you have no control over the ghost, and that it can strike at any moment makes this so much more horrifying. It's a perfect ballance between you trying to find the ghost, and the ghost trying to find you. 

The maps are also pretty good. The small maps, which are the ones you start with are usually either a family home in the suburbs or a broken down farmhouse out in nowhere.  While i do find the farmhouses more scary, i love the concept of the suburban houses. To think that a family lives in the now insanely scary hellhouse you find yourself in is something i feel the developers had in mind when desigining the maps.

The game was so scary, that when i went to the training level where the ghost can't even attack you, it got too scary for me.

Overall, Phasmophobia is a game you should pick up if you want a horror game not dependant on jumpscares, or if you just want to have a scary but fun time with friends! :)",1

However, playing with friends, it does a wonderful job of ACTUALLY scaring you, and each hunt feels very new.

This game is basically just another [i]Fortnite.[/i] I'm not trashing on it, but I'm saying it's simply not my thing, regardless of how the internet tossed it aside.

Most game titles like this half bake the narration like Pillars 2 but BG3 does it right and it feels like I am playing an actual table top game with a DM talking to me and guiding me in critical moments. 
   The combat is also very fluid feels fantastic as you can engage turn based mode out of combat to set up ambushes or just separate the party to operate in real time, they really do give a ton a freedom to the player in that regard. 
   The game is lacking some mechanics FOR SURE when it comes to cooking,crafting or enchanting....but what is there right now is good and feels good....wanna use speak to animals on that spider to see if it will give you some kinda advantage?...yeah you can do it! Wanna see what that sheep knows?...ask him or if you fail the check you get a Gilbert Gottfried Sheep impersonation. 
The freedom in the game play and choices you can possibly make has me feeling like I am actually playing tabletop making choices the DM has to deal with and that is really cool to see and you even have to roll actual dice for checks (outside of combat) which is great to see and nat 20s and nat 1s actually critically succeed or critically fail (so far.) I rolled a nat 1 on some traps and they all went off, reloaded just to test and rolled the DC or above for them and they didn't go off ext.
    There are some performance issues even on high end systems so I hope that is fixed in the future and I want character customization outside of the initial creation menu and more options in that menu (sure a mod will handle that but without using mods would be ideal.) All the major races/classes and custom followers outside the main story party so we can make/create our own or favorites from D&D lore or even CR. I am 32 hours in and I am not done yet with the EA content but in game it says I have clocked 17 hours and have encountered only 1 or 2 game breaking bugs which I did find work-around for and I do save quite often so they didn't effect me much because I knew what I was getting into and planned on that ahead of time but there are some quests that don't seem to complete so far so that is a problem. There is also the issue of quests not showing on the mini map when you select ""show on map"" but that might be due to the fact the PC doesn't know the location yet but the mini map needs major improvement IMHO and I had to use google to figure out where to go next a few times which shouldn't be needed as the quest markers don't update after you get the relevant info the PC needs to move forward sometimes.
                 *Newly found* when needing to shoot down something to progress the quest, said item will not always line up or never line up causing you to keep shooting at it until you knock said item down.
    Onto the enemies and AI. The enemies do however seem to overpower you in some fights when they shouldn't given your level and AC and I feel like they should miss more often on their rolls but I imagine that balance will come in time or via mods which would equate to home-brew style rules I guess. Given what is on offer a party of 4 is at a disadvantage almost the entire time as if you have the high ground a-la good ol' ""obi-kenobi rules ""then you have advantage no matter what and they should allow more party members which speaks to my previous complaint about not being able to have custom members like pillars 2 does.
   There is however much left for them to tweak, fix and add but what is on display is not too god damn shabby. 
This is the D&D game I have been waiting for and with co-op to boot so you can play this game blind with 3 friends and just enjoy a campaign together without a GM. It has SO much potential to be even better and I can only hope it delivers when it fully releases next year. This game right now is full price for only early access...which to most is a serious gamble and was to me until I said f*ck it one night and pulled the trigger but as of right now I am having a ton of fun and I can't WAIT for the full game and the mods that come after. You won't regret this purchase if you are itching for that solo/co-op AI GM guided experience that isn't on offer anywhere else and on top of that the production value is off the charts here and its only Act 1. IMHO this is the best D&D like game out there right now even in EA other than pillars 2 (if you want a wasteland settings then wasteland 3 is up there too because that game is great as well) but pillars is nightmare for frame-rate snobs like me.    

SMALL FINAL NOTE: The integrated lighting is pretty cool as they have partnered with Razor. If you don't own Razor peripherals you can download a free open source program called ""Aurora Unified Lighting"" and enable the in-game lighting effects no matter what peripheral platform you use and enjoy the lighting effects in game with little work.

EVEN SMALLER SIDE NOTE: You can 100% customize your camp with anything you can carry and place down, however if something breaks in your camp...as of right now it is just broken in your camp forever.

617,1086940,"A good D&D game, just a bit buggy at the moment, but that's to be expected for an early access game. Given Larian Studio's previous games, I'm really looking forward to this game being finished, I especially can't wait for the Bard and Sorcerer classes to be added as they're my favourite.",1
618,1086940,"The concept of the game is absolutely brilliant, bringing D&D mechanics into a videogame. It works very well and Larian Studios does a very good job at keeping the imagination and freedom from D&D and incorporating it onto the screen! All of the physics from Divinity: Original Sin are back in full force, along with expert map design that at times amazed me by the attention to detail and freedom, with the complexity of how many different options there are to complete a very simple task. Even when the player fails a skill check, there is usually another way around. The puzzles are very clever and put the mechanics of the game to good use also! The story is brilliant, very compelling and exciting, and has a very interesting way of changing the way you view the game mechanics, which is exciting! The interactions between the characters of the party never seem forced and is amazing to listen to. Every single interaction with any NPC is written and acted so brilliantly, the immersion is amazing and nothing seems awkward (unless it's meant to, which is brilliant!) And the characters themselves are very well created, there is not a single character that seems to have been neglected, some are very easy to hate, others are slow burners, while some you love from the get go and don't realise why until a little while later. Each comes with an interesting story, unlocked by circumstance and exploring, both of which are incredibly well designed. The pacing of the game is perfect, seemingly never a dull moment, with a new quest or encounter around every corner. An incredible game.

However, the early access of the game shows. I bought the game for £50, which was very steep, especially for the level of early access that it is in, but in the very cut short story alone, I have had very long playtime (However this was one and a half runs of what is currently available in the game and a couple of hours at least was navigating bugs and getting a little frustrated). The game can look amazing, but I found it didn't run very consistently throughout with high graphics, be that due to my specs or the game itself being very poorly optimised thus far, and the lower settings make the game look horrendous with very little increase to performance in my experience. What has been said about the camera I 100% agree with. It can get caught on particularly high terrain and doesn't allow you to see anything on levels above your own, until you reach that level, which makes battle with enemies above your character very awkward, but acts as more of an incentive to be the one using high ground. This problem had me struggle a few times and made some of my plans impossible to enact, as the floor on the levels above becomes invisible and is unselectable, which can become awkward.
My biggest problem, however, that I haven't seen mentioned, is the horrible pathing of characters, especially when character become placed almost inside of eachother. This wouldn't be an issue, if it wasn't for a core D&D mechanic: Attacks of Opportunity. There are times when your character becomes too close to an enemy, and to ""disengage"" (which is the same prompt as jump, the one mechanic I feel is a bit neglected) it required your character to shuffle slightly away from the enemy, thus giving them an attack of opportunity and killing that character, which should have been avoidable by taking the disengage action. This problem persists sometimes for attempting to attack, or even move around an enemy, I found myself having to double check the pathing before committing to an action, oftentimes finding no way around it and having to change plans, or thinking that I'm fine and promptly getting smacked for 20 damage and losing a character. This got me killed a lot of times and frustrated me the most, which I would like to see fixed soon, possibly just by separating the jump and disengage actions into two separate buttons.
Lastly comes the bugs. The inventory sorting button doesn't work if you try to resort it the same way twice in a row, it required changing to a different sort type before sorting back the same way (Minor but slows the game down, especially since the menus run at a lower fps than the game itself), sometimes NPCs decide to talk to the wrong character, which has you controlling and making decisions for a character that I shouldn't have the option to determine the behaviour for (at least in my opinion, I thought this took away from the story and immersion), sometimes when picking locks, more thieve's tools are used up than should be, meaning if you fail to pick a lock you have less future attempts than your inventory would have you believe, sometimes NPCs will act completely suicidal. Many times have my NPCs tried to follow one of my characters and jumped from an impossibly high height to catch up and taken 30 fall damage. There is also the issue that some dialogue prompts to do not correctly display the benefits you may have, which can be confusing (especially when passing a check you rolled lower than the target for, because it adds the modifiers but doesn't tell you they have), but the fact it works beyond the UI shows that the game's code, as it's core, is very well-written, which is incredible to see. Some bugs also persist within animations, which can take away from the immersion, such as characters not using their climbing or sneaking animations while doing those things, some cutscenes have ridiculous camera angles and sometimes cause characters to be floating and bending in stupid positions, and some conversations leave the characters facing the wrong way or strangely contorted, which I'm sure is already known by the developers and is being worked on as I type!

Overall, the game mechanics are brilliant, the physics are phenomenal, the graphics are beautiful. The game has the potential to be groundbreaking, like every other game Larian Studios creates. However, the early access shows: The camera, pathing, crashes and bugs are very noticable and take away from the game, even if they are not completely gamebreaking, just minorly frustrating, along with some pathing and camera issues which can be infuriating, but can be played around. I do recommend this game for the amazing story, characters and incredible moments (both player-driven and otherwise) this game has the potential to be very fun and can be exactly what you make of it already, and I'm looking forward to future updates to see it enacted to the incredible potential this early access has shown is possible!!",1
619,1086940,"Annoying bugs here and there, but it's a solid game.",1
620,1086940,"really enjoying the early access so far, the game feels a fair bit different from BG1/BG2, but not in a bad way, they have implemented some fantastic immersion and it feels like a more tactical BG2 and really expanded combat in a lot of cool ways to make it feel more like DnD stuff. Really awesome so far and I cant wait for the full game",1
621,1086940,"BG is back and it's epic. 
Here's my feedback for the devs. Pretty sure in the final cutscene they said they look at store page feedback. Overall I love the game but if a few things were steamlined the experience would be made better for players:
- The selling interface needs an overhaul. You should be able to drag and select as many items as you want (with a single click) and then drop them into the sell space. And when you aren't dragging and dropping, you should be able to move stuff into the sell space with a single click not double click. Having to double click every single item is hugely time consuming and not accessability friendly.
- The number of containers and low value items in the game should be cut by 9/10ths. There's an enormous amount of both and it just takes so much time to sort through all the empty containers and then the junk-filled containers. It's not fun, no one likes doing that. The game would be a lot more fun if instead of say, sorting through 5 empty containers, 4 ones with stuff worth 1-5 dollars and 1 with something decent in it, there was one or two containers in the room and they actually had something worth picking up.
- The spell level system really needs to be redone. For all spells, you should be able to click a spell, then click a target and have the spell fire off, with no menus in between. Having to click on an intermediate menu to pick the level of the spell, or the type of debuff you want (as in the case of the Warlock's Hex) really kills the flow of combat and made me just stop using mages altogether, and just try to avoid using other characters casting that has this element. The way you could do this is: Have your caster automatically fire off the highest level spell. And if you want to chose a lower level than what you have, this should be done by holding shift while clicking, and that would take you into the menu. Hex could be the same. Ask the player to pick which debuff you want, then just have it use that one all the time, without having to be selected each and every time. And like before, just let the player change the debuff by clicking shift (or something) and clicking on the spell to enter the spell menu. Having a streamlined spell casting system would be a huge quality of life improvement for players.",1

630,1086940,"Baldur's Gate 3 is a beautiful game that can't make up it's mind about what game it's trying to be. It attempts to be three different things, and while the gestalt product isn't necessarily bad, it nevertheless fails to deliver on any single one of its aims.

I identify these three things as follows, and will address each of them individually;

1) BG3 is trying to be a faithful adaptation of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition tabletop rules.
2) BG3 is trying to be a Larian Divinity-style CRPG.
3) BG3 is trying to market itself as a sequel to Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn.

1 - Like Neverwinter Nights for 3rd edition (which this game resembles far more than it does Baldur's Gate) , BG3 is attempting to be a faithful port of D&D rules and systems into a cooperative CRPG. This is where the game has the most potential, but it is far, far from living up to that potential. The game is a little fun, but only because D&D is fun, and BG3 only inherits a fraction of the fun of D&D. At the time of writing, the game is still incredibly bare-bones. Not only are entire core classes missing (supposedly to be added later, yes) but the ones that are there are very stripped down. Only two wizard specializations, three cleric domains, one warlock pact... there's very little build diversity here. Compared to Neverwinter Nights or more recent peers like Pathfinder Kingmaker (which even at its troubled launch offered the player an incredibly sophisticated array of choices) BG3 simply does not deliver on the depth of choice necessary to compete with other games in the genre. Yes, the game is still unfinished, and presumably it should eventually include all the options and content of the basic Player's Handbook. But given how precious little has been added to the game in all the time since its EA launch, and given the intended launch window of coming out of EA some time in 2022, I have my doubts that this will be the case. BG3 might well rely on modders to add missing content and bring the game up to the same standard as games like NWN and PF:KM at their respective launches.

Furthermore, assuming that Larian *does* eventually deliver a feature-complete D&D experience... it still won't be an entirely faithful one. Larian could not resist drawing heavily on mechanics borrowed from Divinity Original Sin 2. The resulting hybrid game inherits some of the fun of D&D, but it's D&D with someone else's legs. Which leads into the next point.

2) BG3 looks and feels a great deal like Divinity Original Sin 2. That's not necessarily a bad thing. DOS2 is an amazingly fun game that demonstrates just how good a CRPG can be when it's designed as a CRPG rather than shackled to a pen and paper rule set. If BG3 inherits some of the fun of Dungeons and Dragons by virtue of using that system, it inherits precious little of the fun of DOS2. It's like playing DOS2 stuck in 1st gear. Combat is painfully slow, character turns are not nearly as satisfying, and characters' builds and their interactions with the world are not nearly as elegant and intuitive. Of special note here is just how amazingly anti-fun the RNG is when compared directly to DOS2. The randomness of the D20 shines in tabletop play, but in a CRPG it is an infuriating disruption of your play to have a character inexplicably fail at a task for which you've explicitly specialized them. DOS2's design philosophy of gating persuasion and skill success behind the simple value of your skills is wonderful, and this takes a giant step back from that to wallow in frustrating randomness.

BG3 is a game that asks you to learn to enjoy inexplicable failure, or to grow numb to save scumming. And from a purist D&D game, that might be par for the course. But as the next game from the developer that gave us DOS2? It's a bluntly inferior experience. Obviously it wouldn't be possible to be succeed on this point *and* be a faithful adaptation of D&D, but the game would be far better off if it had picked a direction and stuck with it.

And finally, 3) the game is utterly disconnected from and unlike Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2. The disconnect between those games and this ""sequel"" is so broad and categorical that it would be faster to list similarities than differences. Much has been made of the obvious differences; turn-based rather than real-time with pause, 3D rather than isometric, not a continuance of the previous story, no developers in common with the previous games, etc. And those points are all valid and apt. But I approached Baldur's Gate 3 knowing all of these things, and even so I was *still* surprised by the complete lack of effort that was made to make this game look, feel, or sound like the previous games. From the music (gone are the glorious symphonies of brass, now you make your character to the sound of generic b-grade imitation Dragon Age music that repeats the phrase ""down by the river"" ad nauseum) to the voice acting (suddenly everything in the Sword Coast has a common British accent - even the goblins and ogres, who sound more like Warhammer-style football hooligans than the monsters of previous Forgotten Realms titles) to the UI (which looks very clean and modern, with not of a hint of the Baldur's Gate aesthetic.)

It's one thing to tell me that this might be mechanically dissimilar, but it's still a loving re-imaging of Baldur's Gate. But no, this feels like it was made by people who had never touched the older games, and merely labelled this product a sequel for cynical marketing purposes.

Larian's intentions and influences aside, the game also does not live up to the quality of writing that's associated with the name. The companion characters are written like caricatures of themselves; everyone is an over-the-top obnoxious personality who all but leaps in front of your stone-faced player character shouting ""look at me! look how quirky/edgy I am!"" Baldur's Gate had Minsc, of course, but Minsc works because there's only one of him, and his performance bleeds authentic heart. But then, the companion characters in previous Baldur's Gate games were supporting characters who were meant to enrich your experience, not upstage it. This game follows the DOS2 formula where every companion is a potential main protagonist, written to be the center of attention. Custom protagonists in DOS2 are so lacking in content and other incentive to play them that they're completely unappealing - taking the same approach to writing a D&D game, and a Baldur's Gate game at that, is amazingly obtuse.

In conclusion, while I'm sure that this game will, eventually, be reasonably fun (in co-op if nothing else) I just can't justify spending hours on it instead of on other titles in the genre. If you're looking for D&D RPG experience, or a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, this product is entirely outclassed by the much humbler Pathfinder; Kingmaker and that game's upcoming sequel. If you're looking for more Divinity Original Sin, this is a much less fun knock-off experience. There are too many cooks in this kitchen - Larian, WotC, the ghost of the original Baldur's Gate - and the result is not nearly as wonderful as any of the individual ingredients.

632,1086940,"0/10 can't have sex with a Dragon in Early Access. Literally unplayable. FIX THIS LARIAN.

Edit: Now that I seized all your attention via a funny haha posted immediately after launch (I'm not joking though Larian, if a Donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy can plow a Dragon then it is my RIGHT to do the same, give the people what they want and be forever immortalized as ""Makers of that legendary RPG where you can shag a Dragon"") and have acquired all of your points, I think it's time to give an actual review: 

[b] If you like D&D, buy this game. Period. [/b] I mean it, even just the first part of the game that we currently have access to is brilliantly made. 
[list]
[*] A near perfect port of D&D 5E tabletop rules where everything runs off the d20 system.
[*] Gorgeous visuals and effects with a ton of attention to detail that Larian is known for.
[*] Engaging writing with tons of dialogue options unique to the choices you made during character creation.
[*] Tons of possible characters and branching choice options for tons of replayability, even in this early stage of Early Access.
[*] Larian being behind the game means a very trustworthy Early Access period that will be utilized well and use player input to its fullest, meaning we'll end up with a very polished and expansive end product.
[*] Actually going Turn-Based to fit with actual D&D rules instead of trying to shoehorn in that bastardized mutation of TB and RTS that the original Baldur's Gate games used and people are so blinded by nostalgia they'll continue to argue was good.
[/list]
Seriously, I see myself sinking countless hours in to this game because it's the exact game I've been waiting for and dreaming about for years, ever since I started DMing for my friends back in high school. A PC game that was just D&D except could be played alone or with others and you could just make your character and have fun with it instead of needing to set up play sessions and make sure everybody can attend. 

All of the above is said without considering some of the annoying bugs and instability the game has at this stage, given that it's Early Access and NOBODY SHOULD BE BUYING THIS GAME IF THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH EARLY ACCESS ROUGHNESS ANYWAY because given Larian's track record, I can play confident those bugs will be fixed at some point during Early Access. 

As long as Larian keeps up the good work and communication, works with the community like they've done in the past, and keep up the ambition they have for this project, Baldur's Gate 3 will easily become one of if not the greatest RPG in existence. It's just that good.",1
633,1086940,"If this is anything close to the final game, I'm hooked.",1
634,1086940,"This is a good game. I would say it is more of a cross between DOS2 and Dragon Age than being similar to Baldurs Gate II, but  that is not necessarily a bad thing. Actions matters and leads you down different paths here, so different playthroughs might let you see completely different content.

If you like D&D 5th Edition this is the most polished version of it, but with a few Larian modifications to it.

It is about a 1/4 of the finished game - the rest of the story will only be released once it exits early access. Somewhere in 2022 perhaps...",1

639,1086940,great game thus far very nostalgic and i cant wait for the development to be complete. what wonders await,1
640,1086940,haven't played much but so far its Such a good time. excited for the rest.,1
641,1086940,"First of all, as many people previously stated, this is not a 'real"" Baldur's Gate game you remember playing many years ago so if you expect one you may be disappointed. It is still a decent game, though, especially if you are a fan of other games made by Larian.

The tutorial is rather... entertaining because you are on an alien-looking ship and there are pods and there are kidnapped people in these pods and you have a chance to see a women beating on the glass from the inside and then melting... wait, what? Relax, no, you haven't accidentally launched your suicidal copy of Mass Effect LE through the Omega relay so you are not on the Collector base, take a deep breath... even if the animation is pretty much the same... It is a different game, a different ship, a different pod, a different woman melting down so... yeah... 

Let's look at the positive and negative features, starting with the superficial ones.

The world is very pretty. Lovingly done, with interactive environment and attention to detail. The Underdark is... well, dark and full of horrors. But still breathtakingly beautiful.
Sound track is also quite good. Music often stops playing during combat but this is EA so not a big deal.

You can choose among a few races and a few basic classes. Hopefully, we will get more variety in the future.
Visual customization is limited to selection of one of a few preset faces, haircut, colors and some tattoos. 4 voice options -- 2 female and 2 male voices that don't really sound very different. You protagonist is mute anyway in the cinematic ""dialogues"" so who cares.  

The story is obviously just starting to unfold so not much can be said at this point other than you are not saving the world, only yourself. There are two available sides to join if you wish but the devs made joining the ""evil side"" rather unappealing and devoid of any apparent benefit so you are not going to face an agonizing choice, here, trust me. Actually, it is possible to bypass everything and go straight to the place from which you embark on your journey to your next destination, aka to the end of EA content. But you did not pay $60 for that, did you? So, take your time and explore. 
There is a number of side quests you can undertake and some of them you can get only by exploring the world and paying attention. Which is nice. 

Your level is capped at 4 which is NOT nice. Because you can easily get 1-2 more levels if you do everything the game has to offer. 
There are several companions you can pick up pretty much in the first hour. My personal opinion is they are not well-written, unfortunately. It's like the devs concentrated on the world-building and combat and let a random intern handle the companions. These NPC are kinda over-the-top yet somehow come across as boring and annoying, if you know what I mean. Someone was trying too hard and the result is a bunch of edgelords without a real edge.

There is an over-abundance of skill checks in their dialogues which is in theory an excellent thing but these particular skill checks appear meaningless and inconsequential so failing/not using them does not lock you out of vital information. 

Speaking of skill checks, the game is chock-full of them. Most checks are appropriate and can be challenging. If you click on the option to roll the dice (and you sometimes have to choose which one is optimal) you can't cancel your selection even if you haven't clicked on the dice yet. Can be frustrating but not lethal if you are proficient with F5/F9. And you are, aren't, you. petal. So, no worries. 

Combat is turn-based so if you have ever played a game with TB combat, you will feel right at home. You can also jump, shove people off the cliffs, shoot at the barrels (barrels, barrels everywhere), solo difficult battles with one familiar imp only while your party is hiding a few rooms away etc.  
Overall, quite entertaining. 

Choices and consequences -- I hope there will be some long-term consequences but it is too early for that. You certainly make some choices, and most of them are relatively easy to make, unless you fail your skill check. Gods of RNG will choose for you. 
As I mentioned earlier, there is no incentive to go over to the dark side in this chapter. Oh, by the way, your evil party does not appreciate your joining the dark side. Go figure.

I can't say anything about the story as I get too annoyed at the interfaces that I quit.",0
643,1086940,"Played a few early access play through sessions with different classes. Loved it.
This will be the best Baldur's gate in the franchise with a great amount of game play variety. I am patiently awaiting the full release - but with the amount of fun i had playing right from the release (bugs and all which have been fixed since) I couldn't not recommend this to not only DnD fans but any turn based RPG fan. The combat can be a little cheesey  but ultimately i think this is going to come down to individual play styles. Glad to see Larian Studios giving this franchise tons of love and really going deep with the lore; racial/class specific dialog, the dice rolling and the way you can interact with the environment and Npc's. Can't wait to see what adventure awaits and where we end up, and how the ilithid plans will unfold and how the parasite will weigh on our choices. ",1
644,1086940,"Even just the first act is great, but instead of wasting your time telling you about why you should buy this game and why it is/will be so good, here is a list of all valid reasons and opinions for not playing this game: 
[ ]",1
645,1086940,"My remarks are for the solo campaign only since I haven't tried multiplayer yet. While this is the early release of the game, it is very playable. I like the graphics and story a lot. The movement options such as leaping and vertical movement add to the game play. A wide variety of play styles are supported. There are some puzzles and not just hack and slash. The companions are well written and in-character. The cut scenes are generally well-done. The interaction scenes add to character development and story development. Most visible mechanics are working well. I like some of the representations, such as the visible d20 roll in certain instances which is a tribute to the origins of Baldur's Gate. Early levels progress fairly quickly. The feel of the game is very close to its D&D turn-based roots. There are still some areas that can use refinement for the final release such as the clipping/video-stuttering during some cut scenes/character interaction scenes. Also up noses and in ears, the black detracts from the realism of otherwise very well done graphics. Maybe a bit more variation in heads and voices during character creation would be a plus. Setting up keybinds didn't appear to work except for left click. And, the camera sometimes shows terrain or walls of dungeons when fully panned out rather than looking through them at the character, which requires panning in. Overall, I'm very pleased and recommend this game. It definitely needs a bit more refinement in the future though (especially making keybinds work).",1
646,1086940,"Great game, still being improved but I would recomend this game to anyone who loves fantasy or knows or is into D&D.",1
647,1086940,"This game, even in early access, is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in years.  I love the way dialog is handled with close ups and realistic, and often funny, facial reactions but not overly wordy.  Combat is very similar to the Divinity series, which is a good thing, and allows for various approaches to every battle. 
An example: Was facing 3 Intellect Devourers and they were kicking my butt.  Then tried an approach of sneaking up to a ledge, casting sleep on them, then plinking them with bow and spell.  If one tried to get up, I shoved him back down.  Great fun.",1
648,1086940,"I have only played the early access version of this game, but so far it seems quite enjoyable. Lot's of different ways to complete events and the turn based combat is fantastic.",1
649,1086940,"I wouldn't, generally, recommend a game based in this current situation; an early access title and having only played a small portion of the game. I played the opening part of the game and I just hit the beach (literally, haha). With only 3 hours of play, I must say that I am massively impressed with the quality of this title. The game play is buttery smooth, the graphics are stunning, and the opening preface is very captivating. If the first few hours are an accurate representation of what this completed product will become, then everyone fond of proper RPGs should buy this game and support Larian Studios. In an age full of buggy, mediocre titles riddled with paywalls and microtransactions; we gamers need to support games and studios who provide a product of this caliber.. Kudos to the devs!",1

667,1086940,"I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews. The game is short and has almost no content. The story is meh at best. Gameplay is identical to Divinity 2 Original sin but slapped with a different hud. I absolutely hate this game. I don't care if the graphics are good. There is nothing else here. 

It really should not have been called Baldur's gate 3. Has nothing to do with Baldur's gate series period, in any shape or form. I tried playing it, but the more I did, the more I hated it. Extremely low level cap, very few abilities, and there really are no choices. Doesn't matter if you are a Drow Druid or a Gnome warlock. It is all the same in the end.

This is just another Divinity game with D&D names/words on it. Nothing else.  No spell books for spell casting classes, no choices. Just a pre-determined selection of garbage that doesn't make anything interesting. If you like D&D, stay away from this. If you like Divinity 2 and just want to get another Divinity game that has less content and very shallow, then this is the game for you. 

TLDR: I am biased and hate games marketed as something they are not, especially with this. It isn't Baldur's Gate 3. It is Divinity 2 Original Sin with D&D lore/names plopped on it. Little content and in my opinion just bad.",0

676,1086940,"Not cool just yet. I've played BG1 and BG2 and all the DLC numerous times and play throughs. They were awesome and they were way better--still better than this game. No reroll of the dice for character creation ... that is totally BG. They took the worst of the DM options for character creation and put it into this game to limit players. Don't feel like a totally awesome hero that is way cool and kicking ass. They may make you look cool and sexual, but that wasn't BG. It was all about being cool. Pathfinder Kingmaker does a way better job and even Solasta does far better. it could have been so good, but there is so much focus on the looks and sexuality of the heroes that it misses out on the great game play at this time.  There is some cool stuff. The big battles are really cool, but it misses out for me. Hopefully the full release will be better. I put it aside for now.",0

693,1086940,"**Edit: The developers are still working on this game and i can admire that. My issue is I am dying to continue on instead of being stuck in the first third of this game over and over. I just really want to get into the rest of this. This isn't a negative comment just a beg for completion or at least unlock the rest of the game while they continue to work on it. Still loving the game just ready to dig further into it.

First off let me state that i don't normally write review for games but i felt compelled to write one for this game. My main motivation for writing a review is it SEEMS that the crew working on this game is responding to and paying attention to comments and suggestions people are making about this game while in early access. I say SEEMS because i haven't experienced this personally yet. That being said in early access I am LOVING this game. 

Pros:
- Story is incredible with plenty of variation to let you play the way you want to and can change with a simple roll of the die.
- In depth character backstories including supporting characters.
- Various enemy combatants that keep you on your toes and constantly make you adjust your combat tactics
- *Rumor* the support and attention from the support crew and others continuing to work on the game is nonstop as they respond and pay attention to everyone they can to make the game better during Early Access
- Replay value, even in early access, is very good which is super important to me in most any game
- Plenty of ability to free roam and explore missions throughout the map

Cons: (Yes there is a few even though its early access)
- Still a little buggy during the interaction scenes with the npc with regard to the camera
- Occasionally find myself fighting the camera when panning because i end up getting stuck in walls unable to see characters.
- Could use some additional crafting work and detail
- HOPING for much more armor and weapons selections I am disappointed at the lack of weapons and armor not so much the types as much as the upgrades for each type. Essentially id like to see more of each weapon and armor each with interesting boosts or upgrades
- Combat balance can be rough at times eliminating supporting characters easily if your not on your A game which can cause multiple reloads just to get past certain areas ( I realize this is both a pro and con but i personally dont like it when i lose Gale or another character right away in first round before i even have a shot to react)
- and final con....... HURRY UP i want to see what else is in store beyond early access haha 

So the question i think most people are wondering when they are scrolling thru the list of games to purchase is ""Is this worth the money to purchase"". For me i was hesitant to spend full price for Early Access but honestly I've been playing for several hours now and believe ive already achieved close to the value i paid to get the game. I would consider it a STEAL if it went on sale for sure but once the game comes out of Early Access this game is a must buy. I would love to continue to give feedback and ideas for the game as it expands and i can only hope that the developers continue to work towards making this GOTY by constantly improving it. Honestly i wouldn't hesitate to buy any and all expansions moving forward if the full game is as good as early access. Well done crew and continue your efforts. Nothing can be perfect but I have faith you guys can and will do your best to make this an incredible game.",1

697,1086940,"haha grease go BOOM.
it's a good game, unfortunately because of it being a linear storyline i have no qualms with reloading the game until i get the desired outcome. because of not always seeing the number i'm rolling and it being handled by a computer, i feel no connection to the outcome of the dice roll and it lacks the same weight that dice rolling holds in real life, the game seems to cause you to fail a lot more often, as i've had a lot of times where i've only had to roll a 3 or above and i roll a 2 ""just because rng"" and it's frustrating when you can't fail a roll and you roll a 20 or a 19 randomly at such a useless time, i understand dice rolls are meant to be random unless you play with weighted dice but the rng seems to favor statistical odds and tries to keep things even all the time instead of rolling randomly every time (I.E. i've experienced the game roll highs and lows around the same amount, but never really experiencing a ""lucky streak"" [or ""unlucky""] and rolling high for the next few rolls.) all around a good game though, lots of potential and I expect I'll play it a lot more",1

704,594650,"To quote myself, ""Like Dark Souls,"" Hunt: Showdown is one of the few games ever released, that has a brilliant vision and unapoligetically sticks to it, no matter the cost. Difficult to pick up, and difficult to master, this open world PvEvP blessing from crytek will hurt you. Go into a fight with little knowledge or planning, you better hope the other team is as careless as you (don't plan on it). Hell, face enough zombie grunts or dogs at once, and you'll realize you might have to learn more efficient or powerful ways of dealing with your enemies. The world is lethal, you must learn how to deal with it. 

To quote myself, ""Like Dark Souls,"" you will fight, and you will die, time and time again. For that is our curse. And ""Like Dark Souls,"" after enough unfathomable attempts, instant deaths, broken builds, pure bullshit, *latency issues*, and an absolute hacker who lands 1 headshot on each of your trio WITH A BORNHIEM STOCK VARIANT FROM 25m AWAY; through the all encompassing fear, rage, and determination, achieving victory feels like more than any other video game victory. ""Like Dark Souls,"" the thrill of finally outplaying your enemy is unmatched across all gaming, and because of that, ""Like Dark Souls,"" Hunt will be a game remembered and celebrated, for years to come when it finally becomes mainstream. 

From:  Using new powerful tools, 
           Using new vantage points, 
           Discovering viable builds, viable meme builds; 
           Baiting your enemies, trapping your enemies
           Crouch walking for 5 minutes straight while avoiding sound traps and making your way from the south side of the compound to the north side 
           Cooking a fake bomb to force a man off a roof to run right into my double barrel. He does, and he dies, ""Because its fun, Jan, get it?"" As a whole, Hunt Showdown is one of the best experiences gaming has to offer. 

Bring peace; your patient side, don't allow yourself to rage at every death, play slow and smart and calculated, or you will die, in character and in spirit. To quote myself from 10 years ago, after dying to Quealog 100 times in a row, ""Slow and steady wins the race, slow and steady wins the race, slow and steady wins the race,"" Until you are unbreakable. 

If you appreciate the game design/experience described, do yourself a favor and buy it, join the official discord, and find numerous groups in their active LFG channel. See you at Ram Ranch.

Spooky battle royale. Intense, intimate pvp. Perma-death mechanics. Sneaking and surprising your enemy never felt so good, or so fatal. One missed shot and you might be dead, forever. If you die in the game, you die in real life. That's the thing.",1

709,594650,"I wish there was a maybe category. Although I absolutely love the world, time period, monsters, and getting into what feels like old western gun fights, I cant recommend this game at this time. There are too many issues currently that make Hunt, not fun to play. The hit detection/damage recognition is the worst Ive ever seen. Point blank shots either not hitting or shooting someone you could kiss, with a shot gun and not killing them. And yes were your crosshair can be dead center on their chest and still nothing or they dont die. It honestly feels like Im playing DnD and rolling to hit and then rolling for damage. Its that bad. Some people will say its the servers and it might be the case whoever the next problem you have to deal with that effects how the game plays is high pingers (or people playing from other parts of the world). You have the option to choose which servers you play on and there are way too many people that abuse this. US East is stuck with Europeans and US West is stuck with Aussies and Chinese. The advantage you get with high ping in this game is crazy. Then theres the meta. Sit in a bush for oh 30, 40, even 50 minutes, waiting for someone to walk by or someone going to do a boss. Thats it. You will constantly get killed by campers because the game almost caters to it. Its way easier to camp by the boss and kill anyone that tries it, then it is to just kill it yourself. So if that so far was the cake then the icing would probably be cheaters (115m headshots were you cant even see your hunter), the terrible match making system (which smurfs love), and probably last being the lack of content. Hunt has been around for over 3 years and has 2 maps, 4 bosses (one which was just released a few months ago), and 7 monster types (that all have similar spawns on each map with some varition). I will say there a plenty of guns and gadgets but not a lot to use it on. 

I honestly do think Hunt could be awesome. If they didnt allow you to choose a server and some how reduced the amount of time in a match, I think the game could actually be decent.",0

721,594650,"Unlike most battle royales and their derivatives, there is no downtime in Hunt. Though there are large periods of time in between pvp, the world itself fights against you in the meantime with its own wicked array of weapons: an obtuse environment restricts information intake and makes the mere act of movement a puzzle; surprisingly lethal monsters lurk around every corner; and a panoply of cunningly hidden noise-making bric-a-brac  ensures the careless hunter winds up hunted. This leads to a ""downtime"" loop wherein the player is forced to focus on navigating a veritable obstacle course while straining their ears and eyes for the signs of other hunters, first charting a course, then running, scanning, hiding,and scrapping as they go, ensuring constant engagement; this then explodes into duels like lightening once one hunter shows their hand and, when the smoke and screams settle, the swamp then fades back into that uneasy silence.",1

Fix the stupid Gunplay of jumping around and somehow being able to shoot a rifle. They want some realism and well let enemy hide behind a wall and when you shoot that wall. They dont die. Because you dont have the right gun. If you have KDA system tell players, so they know to engage in combat. Fix making a headshot auto death.

728,594650,"I've always enjoyed multiplayer PvP games and survival horror games, but they've never existed together properly prior to Hunt: Showdown. The PvE elements add another layer to the game that extends beyond the typical FPS gameplay loop of finding the enemy and simply shooting him, in this game your ability to quietly dispatch or avoid monsters will give you a competitive edge.

The only downfall about this game is that the slow pace and lack of counters to dedicated campers is a detriment to the gameplay. Otherwise, it's by far the most interesting and engaging shooter available on PC by a wide margin, mostly due to the complete lack of available automatic weapons. In Call of Duty, you simply hold the left mouse button and look at the enemy with a perfectly accurate automatic weapon. In this game, you have to make every shot count.

The weapons truly have variety, you're not choosing between a functionally identical M4 or AK47 here, the weapon you choose actually dictates your play style, and the best weapons relative to their cost are never obvious and highly debatable. Speaking of cost, the in game economy adds a ton of depth to your strategy. You can choose to bring a cheap weapon and possibly be at disadvantage, which would maximize your reward if you prevail, or you could bring an expensive weapon and risk losing it all.

There are tons of other small things about the game that are great, but you'd have to learn the game to fully understand. Highly underrated game. Buy it.",1
729,594650,"tldr/ i loved this game but its only gotten worse and worse as it got popular. feels early access and if your looking for a serious game id go to apex or even cod. this games massive glitches,slow pacing, hackers that are never banned, and patch-notes that say things are fixed, only for every patch to break even more of the game without fixing a thing,will make you rethink how you spend your time.

graphics 7/10 -you cant turn reflections on or off,or shadows,and a lot of settings do little for the base graphics. performance is very cpu bound.

gameplay 1/10 - this is a very mechanically technical game , with more glitches the an mmo at launch. my kda always hovered between 1.5/1 and 2/1 respectively.but between the massive amount of hackers and glitches its rare you'll have more fun than stress.also most glitches are patched and than literally happen more often. prep for a game with no consistency.also everyone is brown ,quite literally, good luck seeing them from 80 meters in a bush at night through the fog.

story 0/10 -no story mode

gunplay -3/10 - dolch,mosin,label,sparks,nitro,uppercut, and ramero. all other guns(over 100 variants) are a disadvantage. this information hasn't changed sense launch. so the meta game is years old, unchanged, and stale. thankfully the community plays with other guns sometimes so if you keep meta-building you might win just by out powering people with lesser guns. shotguns will do 0 damage at 1 meter randomly on direct hits. also having 200+ ping can make you bullet proof.

overall i couldn't ask people to run away faster. the devs are full of crap and mods(who have vac bans for hacking(ill let that sink in)) will remove negative comments about the game. so its hard to know your getting this crispy fried turd. ive played and done everything this game has. i'd take my advice.run!",0

I love hardcore and consequences of dying and then feel a sick satisfaction when i'm in a winning row and making hunt dollars. This game is a must have for you if you have friends to play with together, because the only bad thing about this game is playin with random players.

I made a review half a year ago to highlight some of the major issues with Hunt:Showdown. This game only has 2 main maps, one main gamemode and a quickplay mode which nobody uses. (It also has trials and tutorials to complete but who the fuck would ever do that.) You would be lucky to get into a quickplay match with more than 2 other players. The second map was released over three years ago. THREE YEARS. That is actually fucking pathetic. For the past three years, the hunt showdown team has implemented only minor bug fixes, (This game is still a bug riddled mess) then sought to release cosmetic dlcs one after another. What a fucking backhand slap to the community. I bought the initial cosmetic dlc because i personally thought it would be rare for them to be releasing such stupid dlcs. Low and behold, crytek jumps on the bandwagon for cosmetic dlcs. Why release new features, new maps, new gamemodes when you could just bleed the community dry for three years. Could i ever recommend Hunt showdown to a new player? No. I've been playing since beta. Nothing but disappointment for this game.",0

If you like it, thats on you, but i for one, don't like it anymore, and i hope the developers really learn off this game and design something better, that wasn't intended in the first place to be a fast paced, rush to the objective BR style shooter that tries to implement hard core elements with balancing issues.",0
742,594650,"This game has the best gunplay I ever played, however it is not for everyone.  This is a HARDCORE game, it has a steep learning curve that should be complemented through a bit of research (youtube/twitch). There are A LOT of great guides that teaches you smalls things that the game does not.

I am a bit biased because I love the ~1890 - 1910 weaponry, but what I like about this game is that every action has a consequence : 
 - there are no automatic weapons so if you miss a shot at someone you are now in a disavantage
 - your shots can be heard in the entire map, and so taking a shot must be thinked over.
 - all actions can be heard, you can crouch to reduce the noise,but you are never silent. A surround sound is a must.

But it is not all perfect : game servers sometimes are bad, matchmaking sucks.

744,594650,"Hunt used to look and feel very good. Over the years the devs messed everything up. Weird and unnecessary updates, meta changes that no one asked for. Not to mention the amount of bugs still present in the game. With every update they add 3-4 more new bugs. They take up to 1 year to understand and fix major bugs. Apparently you don't have to be a good developer anymore if you have a community that does all the work for you. They look like they have no idea what they are doing and maybe Crytek should not develop. Crytek is also the only company in gaming history that tried to nerf player skills. It is a VERY NEWBIE UNFRIENDLY game. It is a very hard game to learn and play, you will die a lot for the first 500 hours invested. No one wants to play with you if your kd is less than 2. Discord is toxic, going random team mates is pure cancer. 9/10 matches are a long 40 minutes of camping fest. As a new player you have literally ZERO chance of winning or at least surviving a match . Unless you camp and play Splinter Cell like. You will buy the game, play few matches, uninstall and want your money back. The game is also a CPU killer, it doesn't care about your GPU. When and if you buy the game make sure you have latest generation processors, decent CPU is not in this game's vocabulary. The only good thing about this game is the looks but get this, it doesn't look half as good as it used to. So yeah, the game is a CPU killer not because it looks good but because of bad coding and little to no performance optimization. Being a small developing team is not an excuse anymore Crytek.

If you are considering buying it then I would advise you to wait for a sale. You will enjoy the game but feel frustrated. There is much wrong with the matchmaking and there is a lot of cheating. Then there is the hit registration issues and RNG.

TL;DR: 6/10. Buy only on sale. It's fun, but not full price fun.

-----
The good:

1) Art: Art departments seldom fail to deliver and the team behind Hunt Showdown is no exception. From the sound effects of guns, the soundtrack and the ambience, to the fashion of the characters and the depictions of cryptids- it's a Louisiana Went To Hell experience, from head to toe.

2) Sound cues: Everything is built to produce sound. Everything. You can use that to pursue people. You can even familiarize with the sounds of certain guns and know who's using what.

3) Gunplay: I'll have more to say on this later, but I like it, sort of. It's not like any modern-era game where we have 30 mag rifles that fire as fast as you can pull the trigger and you can just hose down a whole group of people once you get the drop on them. With only lever and bolt actions, and having to cock the hammer every time to fire off a pistol, you have to be a bit more considerable with how you engage.

4) Development Team: The Development Team has more contact with the playerbase than what I usually see. Communication is key.
-----
The 'eh'.

1) The map: The map is massive. Sometimes a pain to navigate. The Bayou is gorgeous! But sweet Christ Almighty, it is a pain to traverse.

2) Movement: You can only stand or crouch. No going prone.


----
The Bad

1) Gunplay, continued: The game's rules make sense until they suddenly don't. At 40 meters with a Winchester M1870C you should be able to 2 shot someone consistently. That sometimes isn't the case. You nail a target twice and figure he should be down, but didn't, because you hit him in his arm or something.

That feels both awful and counter-intuitive to a gunfighting game.

There's also a perk system. They all provide useful doodads, but, I feel in a game where you change loadouts and characters like clothes, they shouldn't really be a thing. Or they're a thing you can slot at your own preference on character creation.

2) It doesn't pay to be proactive:

Seriously. It doesn't. Engage a boss and people'll ambush you for the opportunity to claim the bounty and make off with it. Your best bet is to just dress up the site with traps and camp until everyone who could come to take it is dead.

Camping comes at a complete advantage and is the de-facto way to play Hunt Showdown. This can feel very unfun if you prefer something fast and snappy like Red Dead Redemption.

It can also be a killjoy because you get effectively nothing if you die. The reward system is all or nothing and it feels very bad.

3) No Solo Only Queue:

If you play alone, you will be a constant uphill advantage. Anyone you take down will be on a DBNO. With a system that doesn't allow you to take out all of your competition with a 30 mag in one swoop, you're at a severe disadvantage.

Do not play this without friends, the system will not accommodate your playstyle.

4) Flow of the game is too slow: With the size of this game being what it is, action is brief and takes a long time to actually engage in it. It needs a Fortnite-esque kill cloud, I think, that pushes people into a delta that corners off the map and forces people into gunfights with each other.

761,594650,"I still play this game, and I quite often enjoy it.
Why would I not recommend it then?
Because of the matchmaking. this review is only meant for new players.
Beware, this game is absolutely hardcore, insanely unforgiving and ridiculously hard.
In order for new players to enjoy and get acquainted to the harsh environment, they need to be put against players of their own skill level.
Sadly, matchmaking has no meaning in this game. you, as a new player, have a very high chance to play against some no-life guy with +1000 hours who knows every single way to kill and torture you. To make your experience a hell, in short.

SO, again, BEWARE.

I bit the bullet just to see, and I was instantly enamored in it's setting, the sound design, the complexity of being able to shoot from anywhere and almost through anything. This game takes time to learn, it's up to you to know and learn what play style you enjoy most. Do you like to play slow and methodical? Taking shots from long distances, slowly whittling away the enemies resources? You can do that. Do you want to be first in the action, always running, and rotating in and out of compounds? Well bring your shotgun and strap up for a wild ride. you can do that. I know this is a hard game to learn and master, and even when you wipe teams and constantly extract, Hunt Giveth and Hunt Taketh, there is always danger around the corner, don't be discouraged on a bad day, take the time to evaluate yourself and the situations. If you think the game might be dying or dead, as someone who plays US East, the servers are very much alive and well. As for people who cry hacker, you get it with every game you play nowadays, man. I have only see a small handful in my vast hours of playing so don't think on it too much. It's an amazing game with friends, it pushes you and makes you work for your kill.

They have the entire map memorized, every spawn, every aspect like knowing if people are nearby by zombie spawns, etc.  They're burnt trash waiting to shoot noobs and yell slurs in proximity...

Finally, I can give this game a thumbs up!  The devs *finally* tweaked the PvP matchmaking enough that most games I'm playing right now are fun and fair.  Prior to these last few patches, I was getting destroyed by max level players with 3000 hours in game.  

This game really calls back to my military days, as you move as a team and stalk others in a world alive with sounds, environmental triggers, and zombies that might wander upon you creep around in a PvP all-or-nothing shootout.  Graphics, environment, sounds, weapons: all beautiful and fun.

There is the annoying PUBG style of madly strafing around during a shootout which negates all cover and most skill, coming down to random luck or who gets tired of spamming the keyboard.  Basically, Quake with single-action revolvers.  There is also a die-hard veteran strata of players that have the entire game memorized and run around checking player spawns, looking to kill noobs.  And there are cheaters, although much more rare now at my lower K/D level of play.

Overall, a very addictive game as you wager a character and equipment upon surviving the match.  You can purchase better weapons and more equipment to help your character have an edge (using free, in-game money), but you might lose it all to a lucky headshot or a hidden player that sees you crossing a road.  The intensity is high in this game, as I've more than once have been stalking an enemy player only to have a zombie stand up out of the water next to me.

Devs: reduce the strafing and backward running silliness.  Aiming down the sights while strafing, ducking, and jumping is dumb.  With the amazing sound triggers and slow firing, hard hitting weapons, I think this game would do better with a touch of realism where kneeling is necessary for ranged combat and side/back movement was slowed down considerably.  Nailing a 180 meter headshot while strafing, jumping, ducking in the middle of the road just makes me think of a game for children rather than a game of planning, tactics, and skill.",1

814,239140,"this is one of my favorite games ever. its flawed and somewhat jank at times, but all of that is easy to overlook when the game is this fun. i've played through the story no fewer than 3 times, all of which were in co-op. all 3 playthroughs were with a good friend of mine. we loved this game so much we played the whole thing (the following dlc and all) 3 full times. also the developers are awesome and have been updating the game and having events since the game launched in 2015. 6 ENTIRE YEARS of updates. about half were paid but half of them were free dlc and game changing events like a left 4 dead 2 crossover. they also added a bunch of stuff to the endgame post-launch including new enemies and weapons. solid 9/10",1
815,239140,"I played on PS4 and finished the game and I couldn't help myself from buying it again on PC, especially when it's on sale, it's a steal. Dying Light is the greatest zombie game that I've played. The parkour is epic, combat is very good, you can craft powerful weapons and more PARKOUR! I can't wait for Dying Light 2. If you've never played before, please do yourself a favor and buy this game, you're not gonna regret it. POGGERS certified!",1

835,239140,Love this game,1
836,239140,"You are Kyle Crane and you are an agent undercover that has to decide who to side with. You can craft, you got skill points that make you better to doing parkour. The game has a coop online mode implemented and you can parkour around and doing quests with your friends or you can doing matchmaking and go from someone else and while you both play  you will see a lot of messages on screen about doing challenges. Zombies are very realistic and they will get stronger at night time. Also great game if you love Mirror's Edge: Catalyst parkour experience.

Cons of the game: Secondary quests boring and repetitive, zombies that you can't lure away unless you have tons of Firecrackers, not many weapons you will find yourself fighting with a pipe that you need to fix constantly, the kick becomes the best weapon, shops are too expensive, You can go around to find assault rifles and powerful weapons following a guide if you want but it's not worth it. City buildings are not so high as you see, dead island style buildings. Leveling up to obtain the best skills for the free running it's too long it takes hour and hours of XP farming. When you think the game story is over then the game opens even more beautiful!",1

839,239140,"Amazing game, i played this like four years ago, came back and i still enjoy it.",1
840,239140,"So I got this game like a couple years ago on sale and it was just sitting in my library till Dying Light 2 got a release date.

Oh, how I regret not playing it earlier. The game is just absolutely fun. Nearly everything about its gameplay is enjoyable, be it the parkour, or the zombies or the excellent night-time adrenaline rush. The quests are reasonably balanced (though I've only done like 1 main quest so far), and the world is pretty enjoyable to explore.

The enemy types do feel a bit narrow, but that issue doesn't exist in the night-time or in the more high-level areas.

It can be frustrating with early weapons, but once you unlock the bigger machetes and stuff, the game really opens up a whole tin can of ways you can murder zombies, and that just amps the fun factor tenfold.

All in all, a solid game to sink your hours in. Barring very few issues, I guarantee you will leave with a gigantic smile on your face.

Oh, and it's pretty light on the resources too (though I did have to cut down details to keep framerates around 60).",1

wellllll maybe",1
885,239140,"Dying light is what dead island should have been. A very solid game. The parkour is possibly the best in any game I can recall, and the fighting feels weighted very much in realism, aside from the leaping dodge moves you get early in game. Upgrading is fun, not too tedious, and really pays off in various ways. Story is solid but the last boss fight is meh, characters are not-too contrived and side missions are great. Graphically Dying Light is stunning, not only are the environments and character models great but it all looks so very smooth as you're hurtling through the streets. But that's nothing until you start to climb, at a height being able to see across the city during various weathers and daytime the beauty is near flawless.

My rating- 8/10

I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something new. Co-op is pretty good :)

886,239140,"Awesome game with great Story Telling, all the items feel extremely fun to use. There are some bugs but it leads to funny moments with friends. The game is extremely fun and has a great variety of difficulties however the only downside in my opinion is the fact you need to repair your weapons. Other than that, The Following is great, Bozak's Horde is great, Hellraid is hard but fun if you play with friends",1
